\usage{
entropy_window(entropy_vec, start = 1, window_length = 25,
  mean_tolerance = 0.001, sd_tolerance = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{entropy_vec}{A vector of numbers corresponding to entropy of each
iteration.}

\item{start}{An integer instructing which iteration to start with (default is
1).}

\item{window_length}{The number of iterations to consider when considering
convergence (default is 25).}

\item{mean_tolerance}{A number. The threshold for how close the mean of the
two windows must be to be considered converged (default is 0.001).}

\item{sd_tolerance:}{A number. The threshold for how close the standard
deviation of the two windows must be to be considered converged (default is
0.001).}
}
\value{
The iteration at which convergence occurs in the clustering
}
\description{
Find the point at which entropy stabilises in the iterations.
}
